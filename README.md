An attempt to create an autonomous car powered by the Raspberry Pi with image processing (OpenCV).I am developing this project in multiple phases.
Each phase will significantly enhance the algorithms and add new features.

**Disclaimer :** The parameters and outputs are subject to various conditions, and the system may not work perfectly every time, even when conditions are maintained. However, it is expected to improve over phases and eventually achieve a certain level of excellence. :)

**Version 1: Navigation using Hough's Line Transforms**
